# Deep-Learning-Approch-for-Stress-detection
This project uses a synthetic dataset with features like Heart Rate, EEG Alpha, EEG Beta, and Skin Temp to predict stress levels. 4 deep learning models-LSTM, CNN, Transformer, and MLPâ€”are compared with LSTM model due to its superior performance. The system is deployed as a Flask web app,friendly interface, real-time stress predictions with advice.
